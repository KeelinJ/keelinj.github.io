    <h2>Resume Addendum</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Conceptualized, developed, and implemented a permissions-based intranet
        platform used daily by thousands of employees
        <ul>
          <li>
            Built an SSO login system where users are granted roles at login
            based on their department and position in the company
          </li>
          <li>
            Created a publishing permissions system where authors can only
            create or edit content within their own department. Further, authors
            determine what user roles can view their content
          </li>
          <li>
            Developed a templating system that only renders the content and
            navigation items that the user is authorized to view
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Established a workflow to pull event listings from a Google Sheet via
        JSON into the WordPress database, and from there sanitize, normalize,
        and validate the data, sort it by US state and chronologically, and
        finally display it on a map as well as in a list format
      </li>
      <li>
        Provided with a broken script designed to fetch job listing data from
        the Workday API, I was able to identify the issue, fix it, and deploy it
        to production
      </li>
      <li>
        Created and configured the CI/CD pipeline for deploying code to omo.md
        including provisioning dev, staging, and production server environments
      </li>
      <li>
        Simplified and completed a non-functioning inherited project intended to
        transfer data through a complicated tech stack from a spreadsheet to a
        HubSpot list via Zapier
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut site load times by greater than 50% on ScribeAmerica.com by
        optimizing how assets are loaded, properly leveraging server caching,
        and implementing other web performance best practices
      </li>
