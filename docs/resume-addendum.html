      <li>
        Developed a workflow to pull event listings from a Google Sheet via JSON

        sort it by US state and chronologically, and finally display it on a map
        as well as in a list format
      </li>
      <li>
        Successfully identified the issue and refactored a broken script that

        and display it to the user

        HubSpot list via Zapier
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut site load times by greater than 50% on ScribeAmerica.com by
